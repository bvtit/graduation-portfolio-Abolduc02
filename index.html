                <h2>Hi, I'm Aaron.</h2>
                <p>I am currently a student at Blackstone Valley Regional Vocational Technical High School in Upton, Massachusetts. I am a member of the Information Technology shop and I'm currently in the 11th grade.</p>
                <p>I grew up in Blackstone, Massachusetts, and I have lived their my whole life with my mom, dad, and brother. I have been interested in computers and other technology since a young age. I grew up playing video games on the Wii, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and DS. My favorite videogame growing up was Minecraft Java Edition on the computer. Even when I was younger, family and friends would come to me and ask me for help when they were having a problem with their computer or other device, and I was always glad to help them as much as I could because the troubleshooting process has always interested me.</p>
                <p>Some of my hobbies include playing the piano and trombone, playing baseball and basketball with my friends, hanging out with my friends, and playing video games. I have been playing the trombone since 5th grade. I played in the school band and my teacher saw a lot of potential in me so I was invited up to perform in the high school marching band when I was in the 7th and 8th grade. I take a lot of pride in that because not many kids have that oppurtunity. I took piano lessons for 2 years from 2016-2018 with my teacher Kate at Larry Bee's. I have been playing baseball since I was about 4 or 5 when I started playing tee ball. I like to play 3rd base and pitch when I play baseball. Since I have started, I've been working to strengthen my skills of baseball. I also like to go and play basketball with my friends. I was never on a basketball team, but my friends always invite me over to the park to play with them and have a good time. I might not be the best basketball player, but I still have a lot of fun playing. I always try to set aside time to hangout with my friends and have a good time. Whenever I am bored or have nothing to do, I like to play videogames like NHL or NBA2K with my friends.</p>
                <p>One of my greatest accomplishments so far is winning the USBANDS national championship with the Blackstone-Millville Marching Chargers in 2015. I was in the 8th grade and was invited up to play with the band, and at the end of the season, we went to play at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey where we competed against the top marching bands in the country. We almost scored perfectly and took home first place and a trophy that was nearly 10 feet tall. Another one of my greatest accomplishments is becoming CompTIA A+ certified. I put a lot of work into learning the material that would be on the exam during my freshman and sophomore year, and it paid off when I got a qualifying score and received my certification.</p>
                <p>I hold myself to high academic standards when I'm in school. I strive to be a straight-A student and always put in my best effort. I always complete my work to the best of my ability and get it in on time. I take pride in being a top 10 student in my class out of over 300 students.</p>
                <p>I hope to do great things with my career in the future and be able to help improve the world and make it a better place. I'm not exactly sure what direction I want to take my career in yet, but I am sure I will find my way and make the best of it!</p>
